## HotConfig & JWT Auth

If the env variable **CLIENTS_URL** is not present a file based adapter will be used for loading config (should run out of the box) however if the **CLIENTS_URL** is supplied the API Adapter will be used which will require on of the following setups to work (in conjunction with login.dfe.hot-config):  

### Simple JWT

**CLIENTS_TOKEN** this env veriable is the JWT key generated with a shared secret

### Active Directory Auth

this config requires you to set up an App and a Client in the Azure AD console (with the appropriate manifest)   
**CLIENTS_AAD_TENANT** Your AAD Tenant (somthing like 'dfensadev.omicrosoft.com')  
**CLIENTS_AAD_AUTHORITY** Your AAD Tenant authority URL https://login.microsoftonline.com/...  
**CLIENTS_AAD_CLIENT_ID** Your AAD Client ID  
**CLIENTS_AAD_CLIENT_SECRET**  Your AAD Secret key  
**CLIENTS_AAD_RESOURCE** The AAD ResourceID (ObjectID) you are trying to access


## Using login.dfe.interactions

To use the [interactions project](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/login.dfe.interactions) with the OIDC server and to have 
request verification enabled, you will need to share the public key. The OIDC server relies on 
a **interactions.cert** being created in the ssl folder and populated with the cert contents from the interactions localhost.cert
